# 📊 Sales Performance & Revenue Growth Analysis

## 📌 Project Type
**Independent Personal Project (Not Internship Work)**

This project was independently designed and executed to simulate a real-world
business analytics use case. The objective is to analyze retail sales data to
identify revenue stagnation causes, profitability drivers, and actionable
business insights.

## 🧠 Business Context
A retail / e-commerce company wants to understand:
- Why revenue growth may be stagnating
- Which product categories and products drive profit
- Where discounts are hurting margins
- How sales vary across time, regions, and customer segments
- Which products should be promoted, improved, or discontinued

---

## ❓ Business Questions Answered
1. Which products and categories generate the highest revenue and profit?
2. Which products sell well but result in low or negative profit?
3. What are the monthly and yearly sales trends?
4. Which regions and customer segments contribute the most to revenue?
5. Are there clear seasonal patterns in sales?
6. Which products should be promoted, discounted, or discontinued?
